##Introduction

The Eastern Mediterranean Sea (EMS) is a crucial geographical junction connecting Europe, Asia, and Africa, rendering it significant geopolitical importance. Over the past few decades, this region has transformed into a major hub for hydrocarbon exploration and production, with substantial deposits of oil and gas discovered and developed.  Countries like Israel, Egypt, Cyprus, and Lebanon have made significant offshore natural gas discoveries, with notable fields such as Leviathan, Tamar, and Zohr.  These advances have strengthened the EMS's place as a crucial transportation corridor for hydrocarbon resources, increasing the risk of oil spills and contamination. This potential threat is amplified by the EMS's proximity to densely populated coastal areas and fragile marine ecosystems. Oil exploration activities pose considerable environmental issues: pollution from production, accidental spills, and operational discharges threaten marine biodiversity and economically important sectors such as fishing and tourism. The transboundary nature of the EMS further complicates this issue, as pollutants released in one country's territorial waters can easily spread across borders, affecting neighboring countries. Thus, effective environmental management in the EMS requires close regional cooperation to mitigate these risks.

In this context, understanding and monitoring the microbial communities prevalent in the marine environment provides an appealing option for assessing ecosystem health; microorganisms are ubiquitous in aquatic ecosystems, making them excellent candidates for environmental diagnosis. Their direct interaction with pollutants and other stressors and their sensitive responses to changes allow for a real-time assessment of ecosystem stress.  Changes in microbial community structure, diversity, and functional activities can provide insights into the overall health of an ecosystem and are an essential component of biogeochemical cycles. High-throughput sequencing technologies have made it possible to analyze these microbial changes more efficiently, offering precise insights into microbial community responses.[[Michán, et al., 2021]](/Users/carlosmartinez/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Documents/Scholaship BIO/Vampire/Relevant references/Microbial Biotechnology - 2021 - Michán - High‐throughput molecular analyses of microbiomes as a tool to monitor the.pdf).

Recent studies have utilized various methods to monitor oil pollution's effects on marine organisms. [Ferreira et al, (2021)](Ferreira, Nícollas Menezes, Ricardo Coutinho, and Louisi Souza de Oliveira. 2023. “Emerging Studies on Oil Pollution Biomonitoring: A Systematic Review.” Marine Pollution Bulletin 192 (July): 115081. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2023.115081.) conducted a systematic review of 390 studies focusing on oil pollution monitoring over the past decade. This review revealed that while most methods employed short-term studies, combining biomarker and bioaccumulation analyses emerged as the most frequently adopted strategy. Additionally, ‘omics’ approaches, such as genomics, transcriptomics, and metatranscriptomics, are increasingly used to understand microbial community responses to pollution.

An accurate picture of microbial processes in situ is crucial for understanding the marine ecosystem’s response to oil pollution. Traditional sampling methods, where water samples are collected at depth and brought to the surface for analysis, often subject microorganisms to stress, resulting in altered physiological states and changes in gene expression profiles. [Edgcomb, et al. (2016)](/Users/carlosmartinez/Documents/Scholaship BIO/Vampire/Relevant references/Automatic samplers/1-s2.0-S0967064514002975-main.pdf) explored the impact of sample collection methods on microbial communities, comparing traditional Niskin bottle sampling with in-situ preservation techniques. Their findings suggested that in-situ sampling techniques, such as the Microbial Sampler–In Situ Incubation Device (MS-SID), offer a more accurate reflection of microbial gene expression, as it reduces the stress that microorganisms experience during sample recovery.
