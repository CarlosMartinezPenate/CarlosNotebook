##Introduction

Microbial communities offer a promising means of environmental diagnosis due to their rapid and sensitive response to pollutants. Recent advances in high-throughput sequencing, coupled with innovative in situ sampling techniques, have revolutionized the way we monitor microbial responses to oil spills. However, further research is needed to overcome the challenges of distinguishing between natural and anthropogenic influences on microbial activity. 

The Eastern Mediterranean Sea (EMS) is a crucial geographical junction connecting Europe, Asia, and Africa, rendering it significant geopolitical importance. Over the past few decades, this region has transformed into a major hub for hydrocarbon exploration and production, with substantial deposits of oil and gas discovered and developed.  Countries like Israel, Egypt, Cyprus, and Lebanon have made significant offshore natural gas discoveries, with notable fields such as Leviathan, Tamar, and Zohr.  These advances have strengthened the EMS's place as a crucial transportation corridor for hydrocarbon resources, increasing the risk of oil spills and contamination. This potential threat is amplified by the EMS's proximity to densely populated coastal areas and fragile marine ecosystems. Oil exploration activities pose considerable environmental issues: pollution from production, accidental spills, and operational discharges threaten marine biodiversity and economically important sectors such as fishing and tourism. The transboundary nature of the EMS further complicates this issue, as pollutants released in one country's territorial waters can easily spread across borders, affecting neighboring countries. Thus, effective environmental management in the EMS requires close regional cooperation to mitigate these risks. [[Samra, et al. 2024.]](/Users/carlosmartinez/Documents/Scholaship BIO/Vampire/Relevant references/1-s2.0-S0025326X2301322X-main.pdf), [[Polinov, et al. 2021]](/Users/carlosmartinez/Documents/Scholaship BIO/Vampire/Relevant references/1-s2.0-S0025326X21003726-main.pdf)[[Sharma, et al 2024]](/Users/carlosmartinez/Documents/Scholaship BIO/Vampire/Relevant references/1-s2.0-S235248552400149X-main.pdf), [[Dong, et al. 2022]](/Users/carlosmartinez/Documents/Scholaship BIO/Vampire/Relevant references/Alhassan talk 1-6.pdf), [[Herut, et al, 2024]](/Users/carlosmartinez/Documents/Scholaship BIO/Vampire/Relevant references/Mediterranean tar pollution event Mar Pol Bul 2024.pdf). 

In this context, understanding and monitoring the microbial communities prevalent in the marine environment provides an appealing option for assessing ecosystem health; microorganisms are ubiquitous in aquatic ecosystems, making them excellent candidates for environmental diagnosis. Their direct interaction with pollutants and other stressors and their sensitive responses to changes allow for a real-time assessment of ecosystem stress.  Changes in microbial community structure, diversity, and functional activities can provide insights into the overall health of an ecosystem and are an essential component of biogeochemical cycles. High-throughput sequencing technologies have made it possible to analyze these microbial changes more efficiently, offering precise insights into microbial community responses.[[Michán, et al., 2021]](/Users/carlosmartinez/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Documents/Scholaship BIO/Vampire/Relevant references/Microbial Biotechnology - 2021 - Michán - High‐throughput molecular analyses of microbiomes as a tool to monitor the.pdf).

Recent studies have utilized various methods to monitor oil pollution's effects on marine organisms. [Ferreira et al, (2021)](Ferreira, Nícollas Menezes, Ricardo Coutinho, and Louisi Souza de Oliveira. 2023. “Emerging Studies on Oil Pollution Biomonitoring: A Systematic Review.” Marine Pollution Bulletin 192 (July): 115081. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2023.115081.) conducted a systematic review of 390 studies focusing on oil pollution monitoring over the past decade. This review revealed that while most methods employed short-term studies, combining biomarker and bioaccumulation analyses emerged as the most frequently adopted strategy. Additionally, ‘omics’ approaches, such as genomics, transcriptomics, and metatranscriptomics, are increasingly used to understand microbial community responses to pollution.

The biodegradation of hydrocarbons by microorganisms is recognized as one of the primary mechanisms by which oil and other hydrocarbon pollutants are eliminated from the environment. [Leahy, et al., 1990](/Users/carlosmartinez/Documents/Scholaship BIO/Vampire/Relevant references/Basis/leahy-colwell-1990-microbial-degradation-of-hydrocarbons-in-the-environment.pdf). 
 Generally, hydrocarbon degradation in the environment is not carried out by a single species or genus but by diverse community members that provide different and complementary hydrocarbon degrading capabilities; furthermore, it is impossible or difficult to culture most of the environmental microorganisms [[Vandera, et al. 2017.](/Users/carlosmartinez/Documents/Scholaship BIO/Vampire/Relevant references/978-3-319-42801-7_2.pdf)], this emphasizes the importance of molecular biological tools study pollutant biodegradation processes at the community level. 
 
Culture-independent molecular surveys using 16S rRNA gene have a central role in microbial ecology and evolution. Owing to new and improved sequencing technologies that increase throughput and decrease cost, 16S gene sequencing has demonstrated that microbial diversity is far more extensive than culture-based studies have shown.[Tringe, et al., 2008](/Users/carlosmartinez/Documents/Scholaship BIO/Vampire/Relevant references/1-s2.0-S1369527408001264-main.pdf). Furthermore, 16S amplicon sequencing and the bioinformatic tool PICRUSt (Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States) had been used to inferr enriched pathways for the degradation of anthropogenic pollutants, included those used in the petroleum industries in bacterial communities from the EMS.[Rosenberg, et al. 2021](/Users/carlosmartinez/Documents/Scholaship BIO/Vampire/Relevant references/Particle-associated and free-living different drivers Mediterranean EM 2021.pdf). Also at the EMS,[Shai, et al. (2021)](/Users/carlosmartinez/Documents/Scholaship BIO/Vampire/Relevant references/1-s2.0-S0272771420308337-main.pdf) revealed enrichment of taxa with the potential to degrade hydrocarbons and to produce surfactants and suggested the EMS has a constant basal level of microbial oleophyles.  

Recent studies have used 16S sequencing and advanced analytical tools to investigate microbial communities in various settings. Buccheri et al. (Buccheri et al., 2019) investigated into microbial responses to environmental stressors in marine ecosystems, specifically how coastal microbial communities adapt to anthropogenic pressures. Their findings revealed that microbial taxa exposed to pollutant gradients have distinct adaptation mechanisms, such as shifts in community composition and the increase of taxa associated with biogeochemical cycling. This study highlights the importance of combining community-level data with functional insights to better understand microbial resilience in polluted environments.


An accurate picture of microbial processes in situ is crucial for understanding the marine ecosystem’s response to oil pollution. Traditional sampling methods, where water samples are collected at depth and brought to the surface for analysis, often subject microorganisms to stress, resulting in altered physiological states and changes in gene expression profiles. [Edgcomb, et al. (2016)](/Users/carlosmartinez/Documents/Scholaship BIO/Vampire/Relevant references/Automatic samplers/1-s2.0-S0967064514002975-main.pdf) explored the impact of sample collection methods on microbial communities, comparing traditional Niskin bottle sampling with in-situ preservation techniques. Their findings suggested that in-situ sampling techniques, such as the Microbial Sampler–In Situ Incubation Device (MS-SID), offer a more accurate reflection of microbial gene expression, as it reduces the stress that microorganisms experience during sample recovery.

Planktonic microbial communities are highly dynamic, and their structure and activity can change dramatically over short time scales. However, due to logistical constraints, traditional sampling often fails to capture this temporal variability. To address this, [Ottesen et al. (2011)](/Users/carlosmartinez/Documents/Scholaship BIO/Vampire/Relevant references/Automatic samplers/41396_2011_article_bfismej201170.pdf) developed an automated collection protocol using the Environmental Sample Processor (ESP) platform, which enables high-resolution, long-term monitoring of microbial diversity and activity. This platform, coupled with advanced metatranscriptomic analysis, offers a more detailed understanding of microbial responses to oil pollution and environmental fluctuations.

One of the critical challenges in using microbial communities to monitor oil pollution is distinguishing between responses to anthropogenic pollutants and natural organic matter.[Knapik, et al. (2020)](/Users/carlosmartinez/Documents/Scholaship BIO/Vampire/Relevant references/Automatic samplers/microorganisms-08-00744-v2 (1).pdf) research provides insightful observations on the challenges of employing marine microbial communities as biosensors for oil pollution. Her studies focused on the dynamics between bacterial communities and seasonal phytoplankton blooms, revealing that natural organic matter released during phytoplankton decay is preferentially utilized by bacteria over oil compounds. This phenomenon can obscure and delay the bacterial response to oil, thereby reducing the effectiveness of genosensing tools designed to detect oil spills. Knapik's work emphasizes the need for a nuanced understanding of microbial activity under natural conditions to enhance the specificity of microbial markers in oil pollution detection. Her findings suggest that future developments in microbial genosensing should account for seasonal variations and the complex interplay between different microbial taxa and organic substrates to improve the accuracy and reliability of these monitoring systems.

This research initiative aims to fill major knowledge gaps in microbial responses to oil contamination by combining an innovative in-situ diffusion chamber culturing system (DCS) with an autonomous sampling device (PPS) and 16S amplicon sequencing bacterial community structure analysis.  A limitation is a lack of understanding of the long-term, seasonal dynamics of microbial community resilience to chronic, low-level oil contamination in areas with oil exploration and production efforts such as the Eastern Mediterranean Sea. Understanding how these communities shift between acute and chronic exposure would provide an improved understanding of ecosystem resilience. Furthermore, there is limited differentiation between microbial responses to natural organic materials, such as phytoplankton exudates, and anthropogenic hydrocarbons. Natural organic matter may obscure the microbial responses to oil, raising questions about how to reliably untangle microbial reactions to mixed organic substrates.



## Research Goals

This work will identify community structure biomarkers of oil pollution and investigate how naturally occurring marine microbial communities in the EMS respond to ecologically relevant amounts of oil-related chemicals. The project will evaluate how well in-situ culture techniques capture the dynamic reactions of bacterial populations to oil contamination, with a focus on regions with high maritime traffic, oil exploration, and close proximity to environmentally sensitive zones. In addition, the study seeks to validate the use of community shifts as a biomarker and a trustworthy indicator of oil contamination in the EMS, and to establish innovative environmental insitu monitoring and culturing techniques.

1.	Characterize the Temporal and Spatial Dynamics of Microbial Communities Exposed to Oil Pollution:
- Investigate how microbial community structure profiles change in response to varying concentrations of oil-related pollutants over time.
- Assess how these responses vary across different EMS regions with heavy maritime traffic and oil exploration activities.
2.	Discriminate Between Microbial Responses to Oil Pollutants and Natural Organic Matter:
- Identify community structure biomarkers specific to hydrocarbon degradation versus those involved in the breakdown and utilization of natural organic matter from phytoplankton exudates.
3.	Develop a Real-time, In-situ Monitoring System for Oil Pollution in the EMS
- Validate the effectiveness of an innovative in-situ diffusion chamber culturing system (DCS) and automated sampling device (PPS) for long-term monitoring of microbial responses.
- Test the reliability of identified community structure biomarkers in real-time monitoring applications to improve oil spill detection accuracy.

### Working Hypothesis
Marine microbial communities in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea exhibit distinct shifts in structure and function when exposed to chronic, low-level oil contamination compared to natural organic matter. These responses, mediated by seasonal and spatial variations, can be effectively characterized using advanced 16S rRNA gene sequencing and novel in-situ culturing and sampling technologies.


## Methodological Precedent:

**In situ incubation and automatic sampling:**
The MS-SID [[Edgcomb, et al. (2016)](/Users/carlosmartinez/Documents/Scholaship BIO/Vampire/Relevant references/Automatic samplers/1-s2.0-S0967064514002975-main.pdf)], has been widely used for its ability to generate detailed timelines of a single culture and its robustness as an automatic sampler, however, the DCS (Diffusion Chamber System) offers complementary advantages. It uses gently forced diffusion to transport dissolved nutrients through a membrane filter and can accommodate six diffusion chambers, allowing for multiple experimental replicates. When combined with the PPS (Particle and Phytoplankton Sampler), the system ensures that a subset of the same bacterial community is exposed to identical environmental conditions but subjected to different treatments. This setup is expected to reduce noise in bioindicator signals while enabling the native bacterial community to shift in response to various treatments. Hydrocarbons and bacterial exudates will be employed to test the hypothesis, exploring how these factors influence microbial dynamics.


**S16 rRNA sequencing and bioinformatic analisis:** 

The 16S ribosomal RNA (16S rRNA) gene has contributed significantly to our understanding of microbial evolution and ecology. Its ubiquity, extreme sequence conservation, and domain structure with variable evolutionary rates have allowed for two paradigm-shifting revolutions: the classification of life into three domains and the discovery of vast microbial diversity via 16S surveys with conserved PCR primers. Building on these foundations, 


advanced techniques for analyzing 16S rRNA data have been developed, such as UniFrac. UniFrac quantifies unique branch lengths in phylogenetic trees, allowing for evolutionary comparisons of microbial communities without the use of operational taxonomic units (OTUs). [Buccheri, et al., 2019](/Users/carlosmartinez/Documents/Scholaship BIO/Vampire/Relevant references/1-s2.0-S1369527408001264-main.pdf)

The study aimed to investigate microbial indicators of anthropogenic marine pollution [Buccheri,et al, (2019) ](/Users/carlosmartinez/Documents/Scholaship BIO/Vampire/Relevant references/fnz179.pdf) two sampling stations in the Marine Protected Area ‘Isole Ciclopi,’ Italy, where surveyed. Samples were collected, filtered  DNA extracted form samples were quantified and sequenced with specific primers. Sequence analysis was performed by a diversity of packages in R Software. 

Recent studies have leveraged 16S sequencing and advanced analytical tools to explore microbial communities in diverse contexts. Buccheri et al. (Buccheri et al., 2019) investigated microbial responses to environmental stressors in marine ecosystems, focusing on how coastal microbial communities adapt to anthropogenic pressures. Their results revealed that microbial taxa exposed to pollutant gradients exhibit distinct adaptation mechanisms, including shifts in community composition and the proliferation of taxa linked to biogeochemical cycling. This work underscores the importance of integrating community-level data with functional insights to understand microbial resilience in polluted environments.

Cerro-Galvez et al. ([Cerro-Galvez et al., 2020](/Users/carlosmartinez/Documents/Scholaship BIO/Vampire/Relevant references/cerro-gálvez-et-al-2021-responses-of-coastal-marine-microbiomes-exposed-to-anthropogenic-dissolved-organic-carbon.pdf)) employed robust methodologies to dissect the impact of anthropogenic dissolved organic carbon (ADOC) on coastal microbial communities in the Mediterranean Sea. Their experiments utilized flow cytometry to distinguish high nucleic acid (HNA) and low nucleic acid (LNA) bacterial populations and paired 16S rRNA sequencing with functional metagenomics to examine microbial activity. The study revealed that communities from heavily polluted sites exhibited higher plasticity and metabolic activity toward ADOC consumption compared to those from oligotrophic regions. This adaptability was linked to mobile genetic elements (MGEs), which enhanced microbial evolvability under chronic pollutant exposure. The combined use of advanced sequencing and phylogenetic analysis provided deep insights into microbial dynamics and their capacity to respond to anthropogenic stress.
