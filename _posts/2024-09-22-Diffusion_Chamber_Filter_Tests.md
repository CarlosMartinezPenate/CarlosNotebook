# Testing the Diffusion Properties of 142 mm Filters in Diffusion Chambers
**Objective:**
To test and characterize the diffusion properties of 142 mm filters with varying pore sizes in a controlled environment using diffusion chambers. By varying the syringe pump breathing rates, the experiment will assess how different filters allow the passage of phenol red and measure diffusion rates over time. The goal is to understand how pore size, filter material, and breathing rate influence diffusion under simulated coastal marine conditions.

- Attach hoses to chamber ports: one set for distilled water flow through the Kynar breathing bag, another for phenol red injection, and a sampling port. 

*Syringe Pump Breathing System Setup:*

- Connect the Kynar breathing bag to the syringe pump using appropriate tubing, forming a closed loop of distilled water between the bag, syringe, and hose.
- Set the syringe pump to varying breathing rates to simulate different volumes of water being pushed into and pulled out of the chamber.


*Semi-Automatic Sampling Setup:*

- Attach the low-volume peristaltic pump to the chamber sampling port.
- Program the electronic timer relay to control the pumps, setting the time intervals for collecting samples.
- Program the Fraction Collector to match the timing of the relay.
- Attach a hose to the second peristaltic pump and submerge in the tank to sample at a specific depth. 


## Procedure 

*Submersion and System Set up:*

- Use a clean tank
- Set seawater flow to (1-2 L/min), and fill until overflowing. 
- Fill the Diffusion Chamber with seawater from the tank using one of the sampling peristaltic pumps before submersion. 
- Submerge the setup diffusion chamber in the tank filled with running saltwater and monitor temperature, salinity, and pH to ensure stable conditions.

*Control the Syringe Pump:*

- Set the syringe pump to varying breathing rates to simulate different volumes of water being pushed into and pulled out of the chamber.

*Control of the Semi-Automatic Sampling:*

- Synchronize the ISCO Foxy Jr. Fraction Collector (FJFC) with the digital timer to automatically collect samples at regular intervals.

*Introducing Phenol Red:*

- Inject a precise amount of phenol red into the chamber’s distilled water side through the designated hose.

*Synchronized Sampling:*

- Collect chamber samples via the fraction collector at programmed intervals using the low-volume pump.
 - simultaneously, use the second pump to collect tank samples manually.
- Continue sampling until phenol red concentrations stabilize or reach equilibrium between the chamber and tank (indicating diffusion through the filters).

*Monitoring Phenol Red Concentration:*

- Analyze the phenol red concentration in both sets of samples using a spectrophotometer or colorimeter at its optimal wavelength (~558 nm for phenol red).

##Sampling Procedure

### Sample Handling

#### Steps for Sample Collection and Filter Processing:

1. **Retrieve the Diffusion Chamber (DC):**
   - Carefully remove the diffusion chamber from the 200 L saltwater tank.
   - Drain any residual water from the chamber.

2. **Unscrew the Filter Holders and Mesh:**
   - Using sterile gloves, unscrew the end pieces of the diffusion chamber that hold the filter and mesh.
   - Gently remove the mesh protecting the filter.

3. **Grab the Filter:**
   - Using two sterile tweezers, carefully grab the 142 mm filter without contaminating its surface.
   
4. **Cut the Filter in Half:**
   - With sterile scissors, cut the filter into two halves while maintaining sterility.

5. **Prepare Filter Sections for Storage:**
   - Fold each half of the filter and place them separately into labeled 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes.

6. **Add RNAlater:**
   - Add enough RNAlater solution to each tube to completely submerge the filter sections.
   - Ensure the filter is fully immersed to preserve the RNA and DNA for subsequent analyses.

7. **Freeze the Samples:**
   - Place the labeled Eppendorf tubes into a freeze box or cryovial holder to avoid accidental spills.
   - Immediately transfer the samples to a -80°C freezer for long-term storage and later processing.

###Sample Preservation

In this experiment, RNALater will be used to preserve the 142 mm filter samples; for preserving the 142 mm filter samples for 16S amplicon sequencing, it’s essential to maintain the integrity of the DNA and RNA, preventing degradation and contamination. The following preservation options are typically recommended:

#### DNA Preservation:
   - **DNA/RNA Shield or RNAlater (Zymo Research or Thermo Fisher):**  
    - **Purpose:** These solutions stabilize nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) immediately after sampling, preventing degradation by enzymes.  
    - **Method:** Submerge the filter in a tube containing DNA/RNA Shield or RNAlater. Ensure that the filter is fully immersed. Store at 4°C for short-term storage (up to a week) or freeze at -20°C to -80°C for long-term storage.

#### RNA Preservation:
- **RNAlater or RNAprotect:**  
	- **Purpose:** RNAlater is commonly used for RNA stabilization to prevent RNA degradation before extraction.  
	- **Method:** Place the filter into a sterile tube containing RNAlater or RNAprotect immediately after removal from the chamber. Store at 4°C (short term) or at -20°C to -80°C for long-term storage.

#### Phosphate-Buffered Saline (PBS) with Ethanol:
- **Purpose:** Ethanol combined with PBS can be used to preserve the microbial DNA on the filter.  
- **Method:** Submerge the filter in a 1:1 solution of PBS (phosphate-buffered saline) and 100% ethanol in a sterile container. Store at -20°C to prevent microbial growth and DNA degradation.

#### Sterile Saline (for immediate extraction):
- If the samples are to be processed quickly (within a few hours), placing the filters in sterile saline can help keep the cells intact. However, this should only be used if RNA stabilization is not the main concern.


## **Data Analysis:**

**Concentration Measurement:**
- Measure the absorbance of phenol red in the samples using a multi-plate reader (wavelength: 558 nm).
- Plot concentration vs. time to analyze how the phenol red diffuses through the different filter filters under different breathing rates.

**Diffusion Rate Calculation:**
- Use Fick’s law of diffusion to calculate the diffusion coefficient for each condition:

$J = -D \frac{dC}{dx}$

where:
- $J$ is the flux (amount of solute diffused per unit area per unit time),
- $D$ is the diffusion coefficient,
- $\frac{dC}{dx}$ is the concentration gradient across the filter.

**Effect of Breathing Rates:**

- Compare the diffusion rates for each breathing rate and assess how the rate of filling/emptying the Kynar bag affects the exchange of material through the filters.

**Biofilm Detection (if any):**

   - Remove the 142 mm membrane filters from the diffusion chamber after diffusion experiments.
   - Stain the filters using crystal violet to detect and quantify biofilm formation.
   - Observe stained filters under optical microscopy to evaluate biofilm coverage and filter obstruction.
   - Use digital imaging software to quantify biofilm surface area.

**DNA and RNA Extraction from Filters:**
   
  - **DNA Extraction:**
    
   - Follow the manufacturer’s protocol from the DNA extraction kit to isolate microbial DNA from the filters.
    - Ensure careful handling to prevent contamination.
    - Store the extracted DNA at -80°C until further analysis.

  -  **RNA Extraction:**
  
     - Use the RNA extraction kit following the provided instructions to isolate total RNA from the filters.
     - Convert RNA to complementary DNA (cDNA) using a reverse transcription kit for sequencing.

**Amplicon Sequencing of 16S rRNA Genes:**
  
   - Amplify the V3-V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene using (341F/785R) in the thermal cycler.
   - Prepare the amplicons for sequencing by ligating adapters, following the Illumina MiSeq protocol for paired-end sequencing.
   - Send the purified samples to a sequencing facility for analysis.

**Sequence Processing:**
     
   - Import the raw sequence data into R for processing.
   - Use the DADA2 package in R to denoise the sequence reads, filter chimeras, and generate the amplicon sequence variants (ASVs).

   - **Taxonomic Assignment:**
     - Assign taxonomy to the ASVs using a reference database (SILVA) with DADA2.
   - **Microbial Community Analysis:**
     - Use Phyloseq in R to analyze microbial community diversity, composition, and structure.
     - Compare the microbial community composition in biofouled vs. non-biofouled filters, and assess any effects on diffusion efficiency.

   - **Statistical Tests:**
     - Use PERMANOVA or other multivariate tests to determine significant differences between microbial communities across different experimental conditions.
