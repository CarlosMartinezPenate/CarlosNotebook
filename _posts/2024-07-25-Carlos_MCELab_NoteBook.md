**Activity:** Cleaning PPS after RNALater Assessment Experiment and Preparing the PPS for Further Trials

**Objective:**
To clean and inspect the Phytoplankton and Particle Sampler (PPS) after the RNALater Assessment Experiment and prepare it for further trials.

**Details:**

1. **Location:**
   - IOLR

2. **Cleaning Process:**
   - **Filter Holders (FH):**
     - Disassembled from the main body.
     - Taken apart, washed with regular water, and kept in a cleaning solution.
   - **Pump Inspection:**
     - The pump was also disassembled due to difficulties encountered in the previous experiment.
     - During inspection, it was noted that the frame of the pump was stuck to the pump head.
     - The pump is a suction shoe technology (Micropump brand model GA-V21C9FS).
     - The pump showed some corrosion on the surface, which was cleaned.
     - Reassembly was performed, but the pump was not functioning correctly: it was not dry lifting and pumping very slowly.

3. **Further Actions:**
   - Checked the PPS manual but found no details about the pump.
   - The pump is to be repaired to restore full capacity.
   - Documentation is to be reviewed, and McLane support will be contacted for assistance.

#**Date:** 26/06/2024

**Activity:** Continue with Pump Troubleshooting

**Objective:**
To troubleshoot and address issues with the pump in the Phytoplankton and Particle Sampler (PPS).

**Details:**


1. **Location**
	- IOLR
2. **Testing and Initial Observations:**
   - The pump was installed in the PPS and tested.
   - Observations:
     - Formation of many air bubbles at the output.
     - Loss of priming.
     - Very slow pumping speed.

3. **Re-Inspection Process:**
   - The pump was removed from the PPS for further inspection.
   - Checks performed:
     - Pump gears were in good condition.
     - The suction shoe was in good condition.
     - Motor functioned properly when energized.

4. **Hypothesis and Investigation:**
   - Due to the lack of detailed pump documentation in the PPS manual (no part list or exploded view), it was hypothesized that a small, unknown piece might be missing (possibly a spring or seal).
   - Based on online documentation for similar pumps, a small broken plastic seal was found on the ground of the IOLR and was suspected to be the cause of the pump symptoms.
   - The found plastic seal was stored in a plastic test tube for further analysis.

4. **Actions Taken:**
   - A report was delivered to McLane regarding the issues and the suspected missing part.
   - The pump was stored semi-assembled (with no bolts tightened) while awaiting advice from McLane.

**Initial Observations:**

- The plastic seal found is suspected to be related to the pump's issues.
- Further guidance from McLane is awaited to resolve the pump's functionality problems.

**Location:**
- MCELab

**Details:**

1. **McLane Communication:**
   - McLane expressed confusion regarding some of the pictures, particularly the one with the "broken seal."
   - They indicated that the seal shown was not part of the assembly and that only one seal should be used.
   - McLane dismissed the idea that a missing piece was responsible for the pump issues.

2. **Next Steps:**
   - The pump is to be reassembled and retested according to McLane’s advice.

   - After discarding the missing part hypothesis, the pump was reassembled and tested again.
   - The pump continued to exhibit issues.

2. **Further Inspection:**
   - The pump was disassembled for additional inspection, but the cause of the issue was not identified.
   - The pump was disconnected from the electronics and stored in a toolbox for easier further inspection.

**Initial Observations:**

- The pump still has unresolved issues.
- Further inspection and troubleshooting are required to identify and fix the problem.

#**Date:** 23/07/2024

**Activity:** Continue Troubleshooting of PPS Pump

**Objective:**
To further troubleshoot and inspect the PPS pump, focusing on persistent issues and testing performance.

**Location:**
- IOLR

**Details:**

1. **Inspection and Testing:**
   - The pump was retrieved from storage and dismantled for inspection.
   - All parts were found to be mobile and clean.

2. **Testing Results:**
   - **First Test:**
     - No dry lift observed.
     - Weak and slow pumping when primed.
   - **Second Test:**
     - Pumping was automatically stopped by the software due to pressure issues.
     - Observed that the pump housing diaphragm was filling much more fully and was tense.
   - **Third Test:**
     - Programmed the pump to deliver 250 mL at 125 mL/min.
     - The pump failed to deliver 250 mL; instead, it yielded 150 mL in the forward direction and 100 mL in the reverse direction.
     - Hypothesized that the pump issue might be due to the suction shoe "slipping" and partially pumping.

3. **Further Actions:**
   - Based on documentation provided by the pump manufacturer and McLane, it was determined that further disassembly and adjustment of the suction shoe spring are necessary.
   - The pump was stored in a toolbox for adjustment in a future operation.

**Initial Observations:**

- The pump continues to exhibit performance issues, likely related to the suction shoe.
- Further disassembly and adjustment are needed to address the problem.

**Activity:** Reinspect the PPS Pump and Perform an Efficiency Test

**Objective:**
To reinspect the PPS pump and conduct an efficiency test to ensure it is functioning correctly.

**Location:**
- IOLR

**Details:**

1. **Inspection:**
   - Retrieved the pump from storage.
   - No oil leaks detected.
   - The diaphragm was still under tension.

2. **Disassembly and Cleaning:**
   - Disassembled the pump and inspected the components.
   - The spring was held in place.
   - Cleaned the pump and readjusted the spring.
   - Reassembled the pump and established communication.

3. **Dry Lift Test:**
   - The pump achieved dry lift and pumping.
   - The software reported a pressure release during the efficiency test.
   - Inspected the pump again with no changes detected in the spring.
   - Reassembled the pump.

4. **Test:**
   - Retested the pump, which was deemed to be pumping with sufficient force and efficiency.
   - The pump was reinstalled in the PPS frame for further testing.
   - It is also noted that in reverse direction the pump seem to have less efficiency
