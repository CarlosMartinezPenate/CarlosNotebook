# Marine Chemical Ecology (MCE) Lab Notebook

**Date:** 31/01/24

**Activity:** Moved Equipment to IOLR and Initial Inventory Check

**Objective:**
To transport and check the equipment and tools related to the Phytoplankton and Particle Sampler (PPS) and Diffusion Chamber Sampler (DCS) for upcoming experiments.

**Details:**

1. **Equipment and Tools Transported:**
   - Crates containing the Phytoplankton and Particle Sampler (PPS).
   - Crates containing the Diffusion Chamber Sampler (DCS).

2. **Location:**
   - Moved from storage to the Israel Oceanographic and Limnological Research (IOLR) facility.

3. **Items Checked and Documented:**
   - **DCS-related:**
     - A box with the DCS computer.
     - 2 partially assembled diffusion chambers (DF).
     - 5 disassembled diffusion chambers (DF).
   - **PPS-related:**
     - A box with 3 batteries for the PPS.

**Initial Observations:**

- All items transported safely.
- No visible damage to the equipment or tools.
- Further assembly and testing will be required before conducting experiments.

**Date:** 04/02/24

**Activity:** Continue Initial Inventory Check

**Objective:**
To check the equipment and tools related to the Phytoplankton and Particle Sampler (PPS) and Diffusion Chamber Sampler (DCS).

**Details:**

1. **Location:**
   - MCELab

2. **Items Checked:**
   - **Contents of a Blue Bag:**
     - 10 DF caps
     - 2 assembled chambers (1 with a silver respiratory bag installed)
     - 1 glass bottle (discarded)
     - 15 DF assembly rods
   - **Contents of a Red Bag:**
     - 10 DF assembly cylinders
     - 5 DF assembly belts
     - 5 Boxes of 10/34 NFx3/4 metal bolts
     - Filters (0.8 and 0.45)
   - **In MCELab Storage:**
     - Toolbox (a second one)
     - Hoses for priming the devices
     - Communication cables

3. **Chamber Dimensions (when disassembled):**
   - 16.5 cm x 16.5 cm

4. **Assembly First Assessment:**
   - It takes 2 caps, 1 belt, 3 rods, and 2 cylinders to have a complete assembly

5. **Additional Notes:**
   - 2 large toolboxes are needed to keep the equipment parts safe and ordered.

**Initial Observations:**

- Inventory is nearly complete.
- Additional organization and storage are needed for the equipment.
- Most parts seem to be in good conditions
- All parts are to be taken and kept in IOLR

**Date:** 07/02/24

**Activity:** Equipment Inspection and Functionality Check

**Objective:**
To unbox and check the equipment with Daniel Sher (MCELab's Principal Investigator) and to understand the functionality of the Phytoplankton and Particle Sampler (PPS) and Diffusion Chamber Sampler (DCS).

**Details:**

1. **Location:**
   - IOLR

2. **Inspection Process:**
   - The devices were hoisted out of the box and placed in a vertical position for inspection.

3. **Device Condition:**
   - **DCS:**
     - Broken plastic fastener securing the Solenoid Valve into the device body.
     - The sacrificial electrode installed in the electronics housing is fully corroded.
   - **PPS:**
     - Pump housing diaphragms feel less tense compared to other devices.
     - The sacrificial electrode installed in the electronics housing is fully corroded.
     - The computer was stored with AA batteries installed, causing corrosion on the computer's metal frame.

4. **Functionality Assessment:**
   - **PPS:**
     - Communicated with the software without issues.
   - **DCS:**
     - Communicated with the software; however, smoke briefly emerged from an unidentified area of the motherboard, prompting a quick disconnection.

5. **Actions Taken:**
   - The issues with the devices are to be addressed with McLane Labs (USA).
   - The DCS was returned to storage.
   - The PPS was left in a position to continue inspections, cleaning, learning its functions, and conducting trials and experiments.

**Initial Observations:**

- Both devices appear to be in good shape overall, with some maintenance and repairs needed.
- The PPS showed no major issues, while the DCS requires immediate attention due to electrical problems.
