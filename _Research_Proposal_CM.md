## Introduction  

Marine microbial communities have emerged as valuable tools for environmental diagnosis due to their rapid and sensitive responses to pollutants. Advances in high-throughput sequencing and innovative in situ sampling techniques have revolutionized how microbial responses to oil spills are monitored. However, distinguishing between natural and anthropogenic influences on microbial activity remains a significant challenge. The Eastern Mediterranean Sea (EMS) is a critical geographical and geopolitical junction connecting Europe, Asia, and Africa. Over recent decades, this region has become a major hub for hydrocarbon exploration and production; with significant oil and gas reserves discovered in fields like Leviathan, Tamar, and Zohr, countries such as Israel, Egypt, Cyprus, and Lebanon have heavily invested in offshore natural gas development, reinforcing the EMS's role as a crucial transportation corridor for hydrocarbon resources. 

These activities have, nevertheless, exacerbated the risk of oil-related contamination causing severe environmental damage. The risk is amplified by the EMS's proximity to densely populated coastal areas and fragile marine ecosystems, threatening biodiversity and economically vital sectors like fishing and tourism. The transboundary nature of the EMS complicates this issue further: pollutants originating in one country's waters can easily spread, impacting neighboring nations. Effective environmental management in the EMS thus requires regional cooperation to mitigate such risks.  [[Samra, et al. 2024.]](/Users/carlosmartinez/Documents/Scholaship BIO/Vampire/Relevant references/1-s2.0-S0025326X2301322X-main.pdf), [[Polinov, et al. 2021]](/Users/carlosmartinez/Documents/Scholaship BIO/Vampire/Relevant references/1-s2.0-S0025326X21003726-main.pdf)[[Sharma, et al 2024]](/Users/carlosmartinez/Documents/Scholaship BIO/Vampire/Relevant references/1-s2.0-S235248552400149X-main.pdf), [[Dong, et al. 2022]](/Users/carlosmartinez/Documents/Scholaship BIO/Vampire/Relevant references/Alhassan talk 1-6.pdf), [[Herut, et al, 2024]](/Users/carlosmartinez/Documents/Scholaship BIO/Vampire/Relevant references/Mediterranean tar pollution event Mar Pol Bul 2024.pdf). 

Microbial communities present in the EMS are an appealing tool for oil-pollution assessment. Their ubiquity in aquatic environments and their direct interaction with pollutants make them sensitive indicators of environmental changes. Microbial community structure, diversity, and functional activities provide real-time insights into ecosystem health and are vital to biogeochemical cycles. 

High-throughput sequencing has enhanced our ability to analyze microbial responses efficiently, offering precise insights into their adaptations to oil pollution [[Michán, et al., 2021]](/Users/carlosmartinez/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Documents/Scholaship BIO/Vampire/Relevant references/Microbial Biotechnology - 2021 - Michán - High‐throughput molecular analyses of microbiomes as a tool to monitor the.pdf). 

[Ferreira et al., (2021)](Ferreira, Nícollas Menezes, Ricardo Coutinho, and Louisi Souza de Oliveira. 2023. “Emerging Studies on Oil Pollution Biomonitoring: A Systematic Review.” Marine Pollution Bulletin 192 (July): 115081. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2023.115081.) conducted a systematic review of 390 studies, highlighting that biomarker and bioaccumulation analyses are frequently employed as tools for monitoring oil pollution's impact on marine organisms; emerging 'omics' approaches, including genomics, transcriptomics, and metatranscriptomics, are increasingly used to understand microbial community responses to pollution.  

The 16S ribosomal RNA (16S rRNA) gene has contributed significantly to our understanding of microbial evolution and ecology. Its ubiquity, extreme sequence conservation, and domain structure with variable evolutionary rates have allowed for two paradigm-shifting revolutions: the classification of life into three domains and the discovery of vast microbial diversity via 16S surveys with conserved PCR primers. Using 16S (and 18S) sequencing, [Buccheri, et al., (2019)](/Users/carlosmartinez/Documents/Scholaship BIO/Vampire/Relevant references/1-s2.0-S1369527408001264-main.pdf)
investigated microbial responses to anthropogenic marine pollution, focusing on how coastal microbial communities adapt to such pressures; their results revealed that microbial taxa exposed to pollutant gradients exhibit distinct adaptation mechanisms, including shifts in community composition and the proliferation of taxa linked to biogeochemical cycling. In the EMS, in a mesocosm study,  16S sequencing was used to reveal the presence of microbial taxa enriched with hydrocarbon degradation potential and surfactant production, suggesting the presence of a baseline level of oleophilic microorganisms in this region [[Shai, et al. (2021)]](/Users/carlosmartinez/Documents/Scholaship BIO/Vampire/Relevant references/1-s2.0-S0272771420308337-main.pdf).

16S rRNA gene sequencing, have revealed microbial diversity far beyond what culture-based methods can detect [[Tringe, et al., 2008]](/Users/carlosmartinez/Documents/Scholaship BIO/Vampire/Relevant references/1-s2.0-S1369527408001264-main.pdf), since most environmental microorganisms are challenging to culture, such molecular tools are essential for studying pollutant degradation processes at the community level [[Vandera, et al. 2017]](/Users/carlosmartinez/Documents/Scholaship BIO/Vampire/Relevant references/978-3-319-42801-7_2.pdf). 



Microbial biodegradation of hydrocarbons is a key natural mechanism for mitigating oil pollution. Degradation of oil-related pollutants typically involves diverse microbial communities with complementary hydrocarbon degrading capabilities. 16S amplicon sequencing, paired with tools like PICRUSt (Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States), have identified enriched pathways for hydrocarbon degradation in EMS bacterial communities [[Rosenberg, et al. 2021]](/Users/carlosmartinez/Documents/Scholaship BIO/Vampire/Relevant references/Particle-associated and free-living different drivers Mediterranean EM 2021.pdf). 


Cerro-Galvez et al. ([Cerro-Galvez et al., 2020](/Users/carlosmartinez/Documents/Scholaship BIO/Vampire/Relevant references/cerro-gálvez-et-al-2021-responses-of-coastal-marine-microbiomes-exposed-to-anthropogenic-dissolved-organic-carbon.pdf)) employed robust methodologies to dissect the impact of anthropogenic dissolved organic carbon (ADOC) on coastal microbial communities in the Mediterranean Sea. Their experiments utilized flow cytometry to distinguish high nucleic acid (HNA) and low nucleic acid (LNA) bacterial populations and paired 16S rRNA sequencing with functional metagenomics to examine microbial activity. The study revealed that communities from heavily polluted sites exhibited higher plasticity and metabolic activity toward ADOC consumption compared to those from oligotrophic regions. This adaptability was linked to mobile genetic elements (MGEs), which enhanced microbial evolvability under chronic pollutant exposure. The combined use of advanced sequencing and phylogenetic analysis provided deep insights into microbial dynamics and their capacity to respond to anthropogenic stress.


Despite these advancements, challenges remain. For instance, differentiating microbial responses to natural organic matter versus anthropogenic hydrocarbons is complex. Research by [[Knapik, et al. (2020)]](/Users/carlosmartinez/Documents/Scholaship BIO/Vampire/Relevant references/Automatic samplers/microorganisms-08-00744-v2 (1).pdf), using a high-tech Enviromental Sampler Processor (ESP) to archive the metatranscriptomic response of oil-exposed marine bacterial communities, demonstrated that natural organic matter, such as phytoplankton exudates, can obscure bacterial responses to oil, reducing the sensitivity of microbial biosensors. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for developing biomarkers tools that reliably detect oil-related pollution. 

Planktonic microbial communities are highly dynamic, and their structure and activity can change dramatically over short time scales. In situ sampling techniques have enhanced our understanding of microbial processes in marine environments. Traditional methods, such as Niskin bottle sampling, often introduce stress to microorganisms, altering their physiological states. In contrast, in situ devices like the Microbial Sampler–In Situ Incubation Device (MS-SID)[[Edgcomb, et al. (2016)]](/Users/carlosmartinez/Documents/Scholaship BIO/Vampire/Relevant references/Automatic samplers/1-s2.0-S0967064514002975-main.pdf) and platforms like the Environmental Sample Processor (ESP) [[Ottesen et al. (2011)]](/Users/carlosmartinez/Documents/Scholaship BIO/Vampire/Relevant references/Automatic samplers/41396_2011_article_bfismej201170.pdf) enable high-resolution, real-time monitoring of microbial diversity and activity, reducing sampling artifacts.  

Due to logistical constraints, traditional sampling often fails to capture temporal variability.
This research initiative aims to fill major knowledge gaps in microbial responses to oil contamination by combining an innovative in-situ diffusion chamber culturing system (DCS) with an autonomous sampling device (PPS) and 16S amplicon sequencing bacterial community structure analysis.  A limitation is a lack of understanding of the long-term, seasonal dynamics of microbial community resilience to chronic, low-level oil contamination in areas with oil exploration and production efforts such as the Eastern Mediterranean Sea. Understanding how these communities shift between acute and chronic exposure would provide an improved understanding of ecosystem resilience. Furthermore, there is limited differentiation between microbial responses to natural organic materials, such as phytoplankton exudates, and anthropogenic hydrocarbons. Natural organic matter may obscure the microbial responses to oil, raising questions about how to reliably untangle microbial reactions to mixed organic substrates.

## Research Goals

The project will evaluate how well in-situ culture techniques, microcosmos setups, and in-situ collection capture the dynamic reactions of bacterial populations to oil contamination.  

1.	Characterize the temporal and spatial dynamics of microbial communities exposed to oil-related pollution:
	-  Identify biomarkers of oil pollution by analyzing 16S amplicon sequencing data of sampled marine microbial communities in the EMS, collected over a series of cruises, pollution events, and experiments.
	- Assess how these responses vary across different EMS regions with heavy maritime traffic and oil exploration activities.
	- Identify community structure biomarkers specific to hydrocarbon degradation versus those involved in the breakdown and utilization of natural organic matter from phytoplankton exudates.
2. Validate the effectiveness of an innovative in-situ diffusion chamber culturing system (DCS) and automated sampling device (PPS) for monitoring microbial responses to oil-related pollution.
 - Deploy the DCS and PPS to characterize in-situ community structure changes in autochthonous communities when exposed to oil-related pollution.

### Working Hypothesis
Marine microbial communities in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea exhibit distinct shifts in structure and function when exposed to chronic, low-level oil contamination compared to natural organic matter. These responses, mediated by seasonal and spatial variations, can be effectively characterized using advanced 16S rRNA gene sequencing and novel in-situ culturing and sampling technologies.



## Methodological Precedent:

**In situ incubation and automatic sampling (genosensing):**

[Ottesen et al. (2011)]([[Ottesen et al. (2011)]](/Users/carlosmartinez/Documents/Scholaship BIO/Vampire/Relevant references/Automatic samplers/41396_2011_article_bfismej201170.pdf)) developed an automated collection protocol using the Environmental Sample Processor (ESP) platform, which enables high-resolution, long-term monitoring of microbial diversity and activity. This platform, coupled with advanced metatranscriptomic analysis, offers a more detailed understanding of microbial responses to oil pollution and environmental fluctuations. The Microbial Sampler-Submersible Incubation Device (MS-SID) [[Edgcomb, et al. (2016)](/Users/carlosmartinez/Documents/Scholaship BIO/Vampire/Relevant references/Automatic samplers/1-s2.0-S0967064514002975-main.pdf)], has been widely used for its ability to generate detailed timelines of a single culture and its robustness as an automatic sampler.

In this study, the use of the DCS (Diffusion Chamber System) offers complementary advantages. It uses gently forced diffusion to transport dissolved nutrients through a membrane filter and can accommodate six diffusion chambers, allowing for multiple experimental replicates. When combined with the Particle and Phytoplankton Sampler (PPS), the system ensures that a subset of the same bacterial community is exposed to identical environmental conditions while being exposed to different treatments. 

This setup is expected to reduce noise in bioindicator signals while enabling the native bacterial community to shift in response to various treatments. Hydrocarbons and bacterial exudates will be employed to test the hypothesis, exploring how these factors influence microbial dynamics.
